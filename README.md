# Textpreprocessing
Contains text pre-processing functions.
- The notebook contains text preprocessing functions for Natural language processing. 
- The methods perform removing whitespaces, html tags, converting the text in lower space and text operations as given
- Raw text needs to be preprocessed carefully before feeding it to an algorithm. 
- These functions help in eliminating the difficuilty to code raw for text preprocessing.
- Data structure used here is list. If text comes from other sources, it is required to convert them to a list before passing it in the function.
